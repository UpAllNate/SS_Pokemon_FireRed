# SpokenScreen

This project allows users to easily add voice acted dialog to their PC gaming experience.

## What this repository contains

The program that will run on a computer to detect specific pixel patterns on the screen's monitor and take automatic action when those patterns are detected. In a practical sense, it means this program will look for things on your computer's screen and (typically) play an audio file that corresponds to that detected image.

## What this repository does NOT contain

This repository does not have the configuration for any specific application. At the time of writing this, I intend to use SpokenScreen to add voice acting to Pokemon FireRed. The core software, SpokenScreen, has all of the functionality needed for the specific *project* of adding voice acting to Pokemon FireRed. In order to play Pokemon FireRed with voice acting, you will need to download this repository AND the Pokemon FireRed VA repository, and then place the Pokemon VA download in the appConfig folder of the SpokenScreen folder per the installation instructions.
